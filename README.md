# University Projects

## Welcome to My Academic Showcase

This repository is a comprehensive display of my academic journey through the realms of mathematics, statistics, quantitative analysis, and computer science. Here, you'll find a curated collection of projects that span across various subjects, demonstrating the skills and knowledge I've acquired throughout my university studies.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

Each folder below represents a distinct area of study, showcasing a wide range of topics and applications:

### üßÆ **Game Theory**
- **Coursework 2**: How to outperform the market ? - An introduction to risk management and quantitative finance.
- **Description**: In this project, I investigated whether an ETF or a personally selected portfolio can outperform the market. Using a Bayesian game modeled with Monte Carlo simulations, I compared a custom portfolio against the $ACWI. The analysis highlighted the potential for higher returns with a personalized strategy, albeit with greater risk. Final grade: 82
