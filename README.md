# University Projects

## Welcome to My Academic Showcase

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences at UCL, specializing in Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. This repository contains my programming projects completed this year, showcasing my work in Python, Stata, and SQL. Additionally, you will find various projects from other courses I have undertaken. Feel free to explore and see the range of my academic and programming skills.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

Each folder below represents a distinct coursework, showcasing a wide range of topics and applications from my studies. 

### üßÆ **Game Theory**
- **Coursework 2**: How to outperform the market ? - An introduction to risk management and quantitative finance.
- **Description**: In this project, I investigated whether an ETF or a personally selected portfolio can outperform the market. Using a Bayesian game modeled with Monte Carlo simulations, I compared a custom portfolio against the $ACWI. The analysis highlighted the potential for higher returns with a personalized strategy, albeit with greater risk. Final grade: 82%

### üíª **Quantitative Methods**
- **Coursework and Group project**: Data Science and Visualisation.
- **Description**: In this module, I conducted various analyses using Python, covering topics such as hypothesis testing, linear regression, and natural language processing. Additionally, I participated in a group project titled *"Understanding the Socio-Economic Impacts of Oil Export Dependency in Six Major Nations,"* where we performed detailed data analysis and published our findings on a website. Final module grade 71%

### üßÆ **Game Theory**
- **Coursework 1**: A quantitative approach to game theory, an analysis of public opinion and an algorithmic model.
- **Description**: In this project, I conducted a quantitative analysis using game theory and algorithmic modeling to determine the UK's strategy on accepting Ukrainian refugees. The study incorporates the Tragedy of the Commons, public opinion data, and a custom Python algorithm for equitable refugee distribution. Final grade: 73%

### üß¨ **Data analysis for Population Health**
- **Coursework**: Quantitative Research.
- **Description**: In my final project for Data Analysis for Population Health, I used **Stata** to investigate the associations between body mass and systolic blood pressure. By employing linear regression and hypothesis testing techniques, I conducted a thorough analysis. My final grade for this project was 81%
